# Project: Warmline
# Step 4 of 7: Full audit and tests of the GUI
# Role: execute this step only. Do not skip ahead. Do not add a subscription.

You are building **Warmline**, a solo-maintainable transactional-email wrapper and reputation simulator.
Replace the weekly work behind SendGrid / Postmark / Mailgun — reputation dashboards, IP warmup begging, bounce archaeology — for backend/infra leads at 50–500 person SaaS teams.

**Monetization override (all Hermes projects, including this one):**
- No subscriptions. No Cloud Starter / Pro / Enterprise invoices. No seat math. No usage bills. No "contact sales."
- No payment processor, no Stripe, no invoices.
- The only ask is optional donations to the project addresses:

Ethereum / USDC (ERC-20): `0x85ee7E71f762d772599cbF1EC20E651B30657521`
Bitcoin: `bc1qxe2zx5tv3hdreaej6s2x4p7han85uey828rrhg`

Put both addresses in README, `/donate`, and every UI footer (GUI and TUI). Do not add other wallets without the maintainer saying so. Do not gate features on a donation.
The original Reality Seed map sold hosted tiers. That path is closed. Do not pretend this is MRR. Measure success as self-host deploys, migrate-dry-run usage, fixture quality, cold-start time, and on-chain donations — not ARR.

Read this brief as binding. If a request fights the wedge, this step, or the donation rule, refuse and name the trap.

## Sequence (do not reorder)

1. Programming the backend
2. Full audit and tests of the backend
3. Build a full GUI
4. Full audit and tests of the GUI
5. Build a full TUI
6. Full audit and tests of the TUI
7. Full audit and tests of the whole system

This file is **step 4**. Previous steps are assumed done. Later steps are out of scope until this step's definition of done is met.

## Pitch

Infra leads will self-host a wrapper that dry-runs a SendGrid export and simulates warmup — then donate if it kills a weekly dashboard job. They will not get a Warmline invoice.

Named substitute (why it exists, not a price you charge): SendGrid / Postmark / Mailgun $200–$2,000/mo.

## Stack

Go, SQLite queue, zoneMTA or Haraka behind one wrapper (pick one and stick), SendGrid migrate + reputation simulation, webhook normalization. GUI and TUI later.
Binary: `warmline` commands include `serve`, `migrate`, `simulate`, `version`, `donate`.
Cold start: about 2 minutes, hard cap 15 minutes. Kubernetes is a bug.
License: MIT on wrapper, queue, migrate, simulator, webhook normalizer, GUI, TUI. No paid relay SKU.
GUI toolkit (step 3 only): [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) v2. Desktop window. Go bindings. Not a browser-only admin site.
GOVERNANCE.md: DCO-only; donation addresses listed; no CLA surprise; 4/4 consensus + 30-day notice for license or wallet changes.

## Always out of scope

- You operating a multi-tenant relay or dedicated IP pool
- 24/7 founder-on-call for other people's deliverability
- Marketing-blast platform, template marketplace, full ESP
- Inbox-placement guarantees
- Subscription billing

Fastest death: founder becomes the MTA.

## This step

Full audit and tests of the Wails GUI. Fix bugs. Do not add features. Do not start the TUI.

The GUI is a Wails v2 desktop app ([github.com/wailsapp/wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails)). Do not replace it with a browser-only admin site.

GUI checks:
- Fixture migrate renders risks
- Simulation output matches CLI JSON
- Donate addresses exact
- No guarantee copy on the simulation screen
- No console errors on the happy path

Also:
- `wails build` still succeeds
- Bound Go methods return errors the frontend actually shows
- Wizard: first launch, Back/Next, finish lands on a non-empty main view, reopen from Help
- Keyboard path for primary actions and for the wizard
- Empty, error, and loading states
- No secrets in the window
- Donate addresses byte-for-byte on the donate view and the last wizard step
- `docs/audit/gui.md` listing bugs found and fixed

## Definition of done

- [ ] Wails GUI test suite green (`wails build` plus frontend tests or a scripted smoke)
- [ ] Bugs fixed, not ticketed
- [ ] `docs/audit/gui.md` written
- [ ] No TUI
- [ ] No new product surface
- [ ] Still Wails, not a side HTTP admin

## First response required

1. Walk every Wails view and write the failing cases first.
2. Automate them (frontend tests and/or a `wails build` smoke).
3. Fix failures.
4. Write the audit note.
5. Stop.
